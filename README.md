This is a small Create/Read book+author project to test GraphQL technology. I uset Express-Apollo, Mongoose and MongoDb on the server side.

The main goal of the project was to try/test/learn GraphQL. 

## Available Scripts

After having installed all dependencies through:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

To start the server on port 4000
